## Tips for Asking Questions Effectively

1. **Ask Open-Ended Questions:** Use "what," "how," "why" instead of yes/no questions
2. **Listen Actively:** Note responses and follow up on vague or conflicting answers
3. **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Never assume—confirm your understanding
4. **Identify Conflicts Early:** When stakeholders give conflicting answers, escalate for resolution
5. **Document Everything:** Record decisions, assumptions, and open items
6. **Follow Up:** Send meeting notes and confirm decisions were captured correctly
7. **Revisit Assumptions:** As the project progresses, validate that assumptions still hold
8. **Create a Parking Lot:** Track questions that can't be answered immediately and assign owners
