# Good Practices for Meeting Notes

## Purpose
Meeting notes are the single source of truth for what was discussed, decided, and agreed upon. Poor notes lead to misalignment; great notes prevent rework, ensure accountability, and create a historical record.

---

## 1. Before the Meeting

### Preparation
- [ ] **Create a template** with sections before the meeting starts
- [ ] **Identify the note-taker** in advance (ideally not the facilitator)
- [ ] **Share the agenda** 24 hours before so participants can prepare
- [ ] **Review context** - previous meeting notes, relevant documents
- [ ] **Test technology** - video conference, recording tools, shared documents
- [ ] **Set up the note document** with date, attendees, and objectives

### Document Structure
```
Meeting Date: [DATE]
Time: [START TIME] - [END TIME]
Location/Platform: [WHERE]
Attendees: [LIST]
Absent: [LIST]
Meeting Objective: [MAIN GOAL]
```

## 2. During the Meeting

### How to Take Effective Notes

#### Capture the Essentials (RAID Framework)
- **R - Risks:** Any risks, challenges, or concerns raised
- **A - Assumptions:** What are we assuming to be true?
- **I - Issues:** Problems that need resolution
- **D - Decisions:** What decisions were made?

#### What to Record
- [ ] **Decisions made** - Always capture WHO decided WHAT and WHY
- [ ] **Action items** - Owner, deadline, description (use SMART format)
- [ ] **Open issues** - What's unresolved? Who will follow up?
- [ ] **Key points** - Don't transcribe everything; focus on substance
- [ ] **Disagreements** - How were conflicts resolved?
- [ ] **Assumptions** - What are we assuming about the project/problem?
- [ ] **Dependencies** - What external factors affect progress?
- [ ] **Budget/Resource impacts** - Any resource, time, or cost implications
- [ ] **Next steps** - What happens next and who's responsible?

#### What NOT to Record
- ❌ Lengthy discussions that went nowhere
- ❌ Off-topic conversations
- ❌ Every comment from every person
- ❌ Technical jargon (unless it's technical stakeholders)
- ❌ Personal opinions (only facts and decisions)

### Active Listening Tips
1. **Listen for decisions and action items** - These are your priority
2. **Ask for clarification** if something is unclear
3. **Repeat back key points** - "So the decision is... is that correct?"
4. **Use a parking lot** for tangential discussions
5. **Note body language** - Disagreement even when someone isn't speaking

## 3. Documentation Standards

### Decision Format
```
**DECISION:** [What was decided]
**Who:** [Who decided]
**When:** [Meeting date]
**Rationale:** [Why this decision]
**Next Steps:** [Who does what]
**Status:** Open / In Progress / Completed
```

### Action Item Format (SMART)
```
**ACTION:** [Specific action needed]
**Owner:** [Name - must be specific person, not a team]
**Due Date:** [Specific date]
**Priority:** [P0/Critical, P1/High, P2/Medium, P3/Low]
**Status:** Not Started / In Progress / Blocked / Complete
**Notes:** [Any relevant context]
```

### Issue Format
```
**ISSUE:** [What is the problem]
**Severity:** [Critical / High / Medium / Low]
**Impact:** [What's affected if not resolved]
**Assigned To:** [Owner for resolution]
**Due Date:** [When it needs to be resolved]
**Status:** Open / In Progress / Resolved
```

### Risk Format
```
**RISK:** [What could go wrong]
**Probability:** [High / Medium / Low]
**Impact:** [What happens if it occurs]
**Mitigation:** [How we'll prevent or manage it]
**Owner:** [Who's responsible for monitoring]
**Status:** Identified / Monitoring / Mitigated
```

---

## 4. After the Meeting

### Distribution & Review
- [ ] **Send within 24 hours** while content is fresh
- [ ] **Clearly label action items** - use bold, colors, or highlighting
- [ ] **Assign owners** - each action item has ONE owner with a deadline
- [ ] **Include a status tracking table** for easy reference
- [ ] **Add a link to the next meeting** and agenda

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] Are all decisions clearly stated and attributed?
- [ ] Is it clear WHO will do WHAT by WHEN?
- [ ] Are there no ambiguous pronouns (avoid "they," "it," "we")?
- [ ] Are dates specific (not "soon" or "next week")?
- [ ] Is the language clear and jargon-free (for the audience)?
- [ ] Would someone not in the meeting understand what happened?
- [ ] Are follow-up items tracked?

### Follow-Up Actions
- [ ] **Highlight open items** - ensure visibility
- [ ] **Create reminders** for action item owners before due dates
- [ ] **Track metrics** - Are items being completed on time?
- [ ] **Link to related documents** - decisions should connect to requirements, designs, etc.
- [ ] **Update status regularly** - don't wait for the next meeting

## 5. Structure for Great Meeting Notes

### Simple Template
```markdown
# Meeting Notes: [Project Name]

**Date:** [Date]
**Time:** [Start] - [End]
**Attendees:** [List with roles]
**Absent:** [List]

## Objectives
- [Main goal 1]
- [Main goal 2]

## Discussion & Key Points
### Topic 1: [Topic Name]
- Key point 1
- Key point 2
- Decision made: [Specific decision]

### Topic 2: [Topic Name]
- Key point
- Question raised: [Q - who is following up]

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Owner | Impact | Effective Date |
|----------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| [What] | [Who] | [Why it matters] | [When] |

## Action Items
| # | Action | Owner | Due | Priority | Status |
|---|--------|-------|-----|----------|--------|
| 1 | [Action] | [Owner] | [Date] | P1/P2/P3 | Open |

## Open Issues & Risks
| Issue | Severity | Owner | Next Review |
|-------|----------|-------|-------------|
| [Issue] | High/Med/Low | [Owner] | [Date] |

## Parking Lot (For Later Discussion)
- [Item not resolved - who's following up]

## Next Meeting
- **Date:** [Date]
- **Time:** [Time]
- **Agenda:** [Items to cover]

## Document Links

## 6. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ **Vague language** - "We'll figure it out" instead of specific decisions
- ❌ **Missing deadlines** - Action items with no due date never get done
- ❌ **No clear owners** - "Someone should..." instead of "John will..."
- ❌ **Too detailed** - Notes that take hours to read; focus on substance
- ❌ **Not distributed** - Notes that sit in someone's inbox; share widely
- ❌ **Not tracked** - Action items that disappear after the meeting
- ❌ **Conflicting records** - Multiple versions of "what was decided"
- ❌ **Unclear decisions** - "Agreed to explore..." instead of "DECIDED to do X by [date]"
- ❌ **No follow-up** - Notes sent but never reviewed in next meeting
- ❌ **Sensitive information** - Confidential data in widely distributed notes

---

## 7. Tools & Technology

### Recommended Tools
- **Real-time collaboration:** Google Docs, Microsoft 365, Notion
- **Recording:** Zoom, Teams, Google Meet (with consent)
- **Transcription:** Otter.ai, Microsoft Teams transcription, Google Meet captions
- **Tracking:** JIRA, Azure DevOps, Asana for action item management
- **Archiving:** Confluence, SharePoint, OneNote for long-term access

### Best Practices with Tools
- Use **version control** - who made what changes
- Set **permissions appropriately** - who can view/edit
- **Link to requirements** - connect notes to project documentation
- **Use templates** - consistent format across all meetings
- **Archive properly** - organize by project and date for searchability

## 9. Examples of Good vs. Bad Notes

### ❌ BAD
```
Meeting with the team about the project. We talked about features 
and timeline. John said something about the database. Mary wasn't 
happy about something. We'll figure out the details later. Next 
meeting TBD.
```

### ✅ GOOD
