read chat messages from image - each person listed line numbers from artifacts list file

create new file and for each line number from #file:artifacts.md get artifact name and list number of people who mentioned line number

create second list where for each name list artifacts from line numbers they mentioned


----------


I realize I may have made an error in my original mapping. Would you like me to:

- Re-do the analysis using sequential artifact numbers (1-18) instead of what I used?
- Use actual file line numbers from the markdown file?
- Clarify which numbering method the people in the chat were using when they mentioned line numbers?

This is important to get right! Which interpretation matches what the people meant by their line numbers?
